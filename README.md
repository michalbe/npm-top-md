# npm-top-md by [@michalbe](http://github.com/michalbe) #
Generates list of top npm contributors in markdown

### How to use: ###
```bash
sudo npm install -g npm-top-md
```
then:
```bash
npm-top-md
```

It will generate [TOP-NPM-CONTRIBUTORS.md](https://gist.github.com/michalbe/71f6f9e5938eeb781dc4) file in a current directory. This tool uses [npmtop](https://www.npmjs.org/package/npmtop) package created by [James Halliday](https://github.com/substack), forked & updated by [Xiuyu Li](https://github.com/nickleefly) in April 2013 (current npm version doesn't work). I rendered the list as a gist - [TOP NPM CONTRIBUTORS](https://gist.github.com/michalbe/71f6f9e5938eeb781dc4), and will update it once a week or so.
